# git-easy
Improve your productivity with Git Easy. This simple tool allows you
to access your git repos through your prefer shortcut. 

## Configure shortcut
By default, we allocate ``[ctrl] + [shift] + [`]`` as the global shortcut to open git-easy. 
If you want to modify it, you just need to edit our configuration file, stored in `~/.config/git-easy/data.json` (`C:\Users\%USER%\AppData\Roaming\git-easy` for windows users).
This file is automatically generated once you run the app for the first time. Once in the file, you must 
edit `globalShortcut` key to whatever you prefer. Please see that only [Electron accelerators](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md) are accepted as valid shortcuts. Once a shorcut is updated, you must restart the app for it to take effect.

## Install and Setup
Git Easy is compatible with *Linux*, *Mac* and *Windows*. First get the
installation file from [here](https://github.com/wistcc/git-easy/releases/).
Next step is to configure your desired console to open your git repos, use
the upper dropdown menu for that. Finally, add the folder where your repos
are clicking the browse button.

## Using Git Easy
This app is running as soon as the operating system is up. Press the shortcut
and click the repo to open it. Things you can do:
- Add folder to list all Git repositories inside it.
- Add Git repository folders.
- Remove saved folder.
- Open Git repository folder with the selected console.
- Use numbers to open the 10 first listed repos.
- Start typing to filter repos immediately.
- The `All` option is automatically and it list the repos on all the saved directories.
